            "content": "Conversational applications are becoming a common trend in the software industry. Natural language understanding ( NLU ) is one of the areas of artificial intelligence that has seen the greatest adoption into mainstream applications. While the process of building simple, domain-specific chatbots has gotten way easier, building large scale, multi-agent conversational applications remains a massive challenge. Uber might be considered one of the world’s prototypical environments for the implementation of conversational agents. While, at first glimpse, it might have been surprising that Uber decided to implement their own conversational AI platform, it all makes sense once you factor in the scale of the scenarios.",

            "content": "Instead of hardcoding rules to enforce the quality of data, wouldn’t it be possible to leverage machine learning to learn the key pattern of a dataset and infer the relevant rules? This has been the approach followed by platforms like Trifacta, Paxata, Alation and several new vendors. DQM relies on statistical modeling to detect the most destructive anomalies in data sources and alert the relevant parties. DQM transforms any data table into a multi-dimensional time series that can be analyzed for historical pattern detections. The solution combines a clever statistical methodology with a simple implementation.",

Small inconsistencies or missing values can have a drastic negative impact on the training of machine learning models. The DQM solution combines a clever statistical methodology with a simple implementation. Uber’s DQM starts by condensing the time series dataset into a representation that is easier to analyze. The next step in the process is to detect anomalies. After the anomaly detection process, DQm needs to score the severity of the anomalies in order to alert the relevant parties.",
